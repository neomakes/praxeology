## The Problem

**Parallelization is solved.** Today's AI coding tools already make individual agents incredibly productive. Running 5 agents in parallel is a solved problem.

**Coordination is not.** When those 5 agents finish their work, who resolves conflicts? Who verifies consistency? Who prevents Agent A from overwriting Agent B's decisions? Who stops role drift across sessions? Multi-agent frameworks solve the *start* — Praxeology solves what comes after: **coordination, state tracking, conflict resolution, and evolutionary alignment.**

**Praxeology is the missing governance layer.** It sits above your coding tools, not replacing them — ensuring your agents operate as a coherent organization rather than a collection of independent chatbots.

---

## Production Proof

This isn't theory. [NeoMakes](https://neomakes.com) runs this every day.

> **1 human + 9 AI agents · 38 governance rules · 7 departments**
> Daily todos → Weekly reviews → Monthly amendments
> Agents detect gaps, propose fixes, evolve their own SOPs.

Each agent has defined **Speech Rules** (sentence limits, tone), **Anti-Patterns** (forbidden behaviors), and **Emotional Triggers** (situation-dependent response changes) — ensuring consistent, distinguishable behavior across all 9 agents. NeoMakes is one instance. Yours will look different.

---

## How It Works

A 4+1 tier governance hierarchy. Simple. Universal.

```
Strategy (WHY) → Doctrine (WHAT) → Procedure (HOW) → Playbook (PATTERNS) → Execution (NOW)
```

Higher tiers always override lower ones. No exceptions. Agents resolve decisions by walking up the hierarchy — stopping at the first level that covers the situation.

---

## What Makes It Different

Not a feature list. A coordination problem solver.

| Your Problem | Praxeology's Answer |
|---|---|
| Agents drift from their role over sessions | **ConstitutionalGuard** — 4-layer behavioral verification |
| No way to safely constrain agent actions | **SafetyGate** — Higher tiers lock critical rules that lower tiers cannot override |
| Agents can't improve their own processes | **SOP Evolution** — Learn-Compress-Apply loop. Gradient descent for governance |
| Changes in one place break another | **Review Cascade** — Bidirectional propagation (up and down the hierarchy) |
| Agents can't flag when rules are bad | **Proposal Flow** — Structured amendment requests from any agent to the founder |
| No institutional memory across sessions | **Work Cycle** — Daily gaps → weekly proposals → monthly amendments → quarterly reviews |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neomakes/praxeology.git my-org
cd my-org
bash setup.sh    # Interactive wizard: org name, mission, departments, agents
bash launch.sh   # Your governance system is live
```

> **New?** Start with [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) and [Role Design Guide](docs/role-design.md).

---

## Agent Design System

Every agent gets a `CLAUDE.md` that defines not just *what* it does, but *how* it behaves:

```
Identity → Persona → Speech Rules → Anti-Patterns → Emotional Triggers → Values → Boundaries
```

This makes agents **distinguishable, consistent, and bounded**. A QA agent sounds different from an executor. A planner never writes code. A reviewer never approves their own work. See [Role Design Guide](docs/role-design.md) for the full template and scaling strategies (3 to 15+ agents).

---

## Examples

- [examples/solo-dev/](examples/solo-dev/) — Solo developer + 3 agents (minimal)
- [examples/tech-startup/](examples/tech-startup/) — Early-stage software company
- [examples/one-piece-crew/](examples/one-piece-crew/) — Fictional crew with full persona system

## The Theory — Why This Works

The same 4+1 tier structure appears across every domain of organized action:

| Tier | National Law | Military (C2) | Corporate | Individual | Deep Learning | Essence |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **1 Strategy** | Constitution | National Defense Strategy | Articles of Incorporation | Values & Identity | Objective function *J*, Manifold | **Why** — fundamental purpose |
| **2 Doctrine** | Statute Law | Operational Doctrine | Corporate Regulations | Personal Principles | Constraints *g(x) ≤ 0* | **What** — principles & boundaries |
| **3 Procedure** | Decree / Rules | OPLAN / OPORD | Operating Guidelines | Goals & Routines | Policy *π*, Control input *u* | **How** — resource allocation |
| **4 Playbook** | Administrative Rules | TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) | SOP / Best Practices | Habits & Mastery | Deterministic mapping *y = f(x)* | **Execute** — repeatable patterns |
| **Exec** | Enforcement | FRAGO / C2 | Work Execution | Flow & Adaptation | Feedback loop *Δe*, Kalman filter | **Now** — real-time control |

Governance is not domain-specific. The pattern is universal. A framework that works for a military unit works for a startup or an AI agent fleet. For the full mathematical mapping (systems engineering, gradient descent), see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Origin

Built by **[NeoMakes](https://neomakes.com)** — a one-person company developing on-device AI for extreme environments. The framework emerged from governing a fleet of AI agents with the same rigor applied to military command structures.

The name comes from praxeology, the study of human action. Purposeful action has structure. That structure is universal. Make it explicit, and you can govern anything.
